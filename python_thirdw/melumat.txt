To create an app you have to write in terminal following:
./manage.py startapp nameofapp
After creating each app (blog,account), they have to be added to installed_apps in settings.py
requirements:
1. If project is large enough, you can split it into small apps
in app namely blog:
1.__init__.py: is place for codes to be done first when app run 
2. admin.py: place for models(tables)
3. views.py: is like a route in flask
4. MVT(MODELS, VIEWS,TEMPLATES):
USER>>>>>>DJANGO>>>>>URL>>>>>View>>>(models>>>data,templates)
as you can see above USER(PC or client) sends command to django request in url(path)
 django receives it as route in view and in response connects it with models which add data in 
 database and shows that data at templates 
USER: request from user can be in two type . info from database which is dynamic data such as you
 want to find info about smth which included in database or simple response like showing
  common HTML codes,links or etc. These locate in template
